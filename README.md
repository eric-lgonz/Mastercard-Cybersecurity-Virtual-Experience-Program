# Mastercard-Cybersecurity-Virtual-Experience-Program

In this job simulation, I served as an analyst on Mastercard's Security Awareness Team. I helped identify and report security threats such as phishing, analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust security training, and implemented training courses and procedures for those teams. As a part of this program, I created a presentation to help teams improve security awareness. This repo contains the presentation I created, as well as my certificate of completion for the program.
